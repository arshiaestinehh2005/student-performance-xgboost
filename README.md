# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using XGBoost

This project applies advanced machine learning techniques, specifically **XGBoost Regression**, to predict student academic performance based on multiple personal, academic, and behavioral factors. It provides insights into which features influence grades the most and demonstrates a full ML pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates a student’s academic score based on features like study time, extracurricular activities, test preparation, and more. The model aims to:

- Help educators identify students at risk.
- Optimize support strategies based on influential features.
- Demonstrate the power of XGBoost in regression problems.
